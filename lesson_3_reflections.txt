When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when I need to share my project's files with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Doing it manually I am able to control the changes better and smarter!

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is a copy of a repo to another location only in GitHub. Changing the fork won't affect the original Repo.
Clone is a copy of a repo to any location. Changing a Clone might affect the original repo if pushed 
Branch is done for making changes to a project separately.
